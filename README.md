# Self-Balancing-Robot-using-esp-32
A self-balancing robot is a two-wheeled robotic system that uses control algorithms and sensors to maintain its balance.
Self-Balancing Control: Implements a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control loop for stable vertical balancing.
Motion Sensing: Utilizes the MPU-6050 (or similar) Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to measure tilt angle and angular velocity.
AREAS OF APPLICATION:Robotics and Automation,Industrial Automation,Human-Robot Interaction,Search and Rescue Operations.
